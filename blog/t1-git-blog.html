      Open Source might seem like a beautiful thing--you make code, other people can see your code, other people can contribute and help out with your code, you can help others with their code, everybody is friends! But as you can imagine, this can also become a messy situation if you don't keep track of the original, master code. You might get upset if someone changed your code without your permission. Or what if someone claims they wrote your code when you were actually the first person to write it! Enter Git--a version control system that allows you to track changes, and manage the changes that are made to the master code. Version control systems, such as git, makes it possible for Open Source to be a manageable space. It can also help you as a developer organize and keep track of the changes you make on your code. This is not only beneficial as you develop your coding skills, but it can probably help you save previous code that worked better than the changes you made recently.

        Git allows you to keep track of these changes through a time stamped system. It saves the things that you deleted and added.

        Git is a system that is on your local computer. GitHub, on the other hand, is a remote system via the Internet. Saving your code on GitHub can be an easy way to share your code with others, to get feedback, suggestions, and solutions. Plus, in case your computer crashes and loses all your files, you'll have them stored online.
