        <h4>On Stereotype Threats</h4>
        <h4>September 5, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
          Took a break from coding exercises this week to reflect on how stereotype threats affect one's performance; in the face of stereotype threat, people feel framed by the stereotypes held against them, making them feel anxious to the point of "shutting down" when asked to perform. In a way, stereotype threats act almost like "self-fulfilling prophesies", just not in a good way. The idea is usually discussed in the context of academic performance among minority students.

          <i><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">This article</a></i> discusses an interesting study exploring how stereotype threats affect minority students (African American students were the focus of the studies included). The studies, which compared the performance of Black and White students of the same socioeconomic class and academic ability, make clear that when minorities feel stereotyped by others around them, whether it be a teacher, evaluator, or peer, they do not perform to their true ability due to the fear that their performance would only prove the stereotype to be true. Interestingly, the studies have also found that when the psychological burden of stereotypes is lessened in the context of performing, the Black students in the studies performed at par with their White peers.

          While I thought this article presented helpful implications for both minorities and non-minorities, I was insulted that the author chose to exclude Asians when he discussing possible education policies on providing non-biased learning environments for minorities (he writes "Education policy relevant to non-Asian minorities might fruitfully shift its focus toward fostering racial trust in the schooling situationâ€”at least among students who come to school with good skills and high expectations."); he assumes that Asian students don't face any negative stereotypes that affect their academic performance. Perhaps it's true that <i>EAST</i> Asian students in general do ok in school. However, even among the highest performing Asian students, Asian students face the negative stereotype that they lack creativity and rely on rote memorization; Asian students are assumed to be "robotic" students, who perform straight out of the book, and are unable to come up with innovative ideas and thought; people do not expect Asian students to have strong opinions or questions about controversial topics. All of these stereotypes and expectations hurt the overall performance and participation of Asians not only in academic settings, but also in society and the job market--how could the author exclude Asian students from the discussion on creating safe learning environments?

          As a woman and an Asian-American born in the US, I'm all too familiar with these biases. The irony behind the stereotype Asian students face is that we are expected to perform without actually participating. And indeed this stereotype is manifested in most public settings, such as the classroom or meetings. I won't go too deep into my experiences, but it's interesting to trace how I went from being a confident and outspoken student to the typical quiet and reserved female Asian student: In the 5th grade, my teacher asked me to quiet down because I was "too loud" as I excitedly shared my ideas with my group. In the 7th grade, my social studies teacher asked my class what the 13 stripes on the American flag represented. Seeing that the rest of the class was uncomfortably silent, I raised my hand to answer that the stripes represented the 13 original colonies. He scolded the rest of my peers (all White) and remarked, "how is it that <i>this</i> young lady knows the answer to the question and you all don't?" as if I shouldn't have been able to answer the question. In the 12th grade, I boycotted an AP Statistics test to make a statement; I was furious that the school administrators decided to allow an uncertified, student teacher to teach our class for the rest of the year while the original teacher was away on maternity leave. Rather than considering how I took my education seriously, especially in an AP course, the math department chose to punish me--they threatened to write a letter to the college I planned to matriculate to in the fall, stating that my behavior made my acceptance to the college questionable, reduced my grade in the class by 20%, and put me on trial to reconsider my membership with the National Honors Society. By the time I reached college, I was pretty withdrawn in the classroom and I found it extremely difficult to actively participate in class discussions. I was intimidated when asked to speak, because I thought others around me did not expect to have opinions or intriguing thoughts to share. It took me a few years before regaining enough confidence to publicly share my thoughts, views, ideas and opinions. It is still a work in progress. Even during DBC sessions, I find myself acting differently when pairing with a male student. But I appreciate DBC's efforts to awareness about these kinds of social issues. It truly makes a difference and I find myself learning with a stronger determination than before.

          The only question I am left with is how people can overcome stereotype threats. The article discusses possible ways in which others can change their assumptions and expectations around minority students. But what are the implications of the studies for minority students themselves? What strategies do you use when faced with stereotype threats?
