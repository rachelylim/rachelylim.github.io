        <h4>On Pairing and Feedback</h4>
        <h4>August 27, 2015</h4>

            <i>Pairing Sessions:</i>
            <br />
            I was nervous about DBC's pairing sessions when I first started. I was never good with working with partners or groups in the past--sometimes because I was intimidated by group members/partners, sometimes because I wasn't confident about the concepts I was learning, and sometimes because I felt held back by my group members/partners. I don't have very many fond memories working with other people. That's why I was pleasantly surprised by how much I've been enjoying my pairing sessions so far! Maybe it's because everyone in DBC is proactive about participating, researching, and doing their part of the assignment, but I've found every session to be incredibly helpful. Granted, there have been sessions when I felt frustrated--we either went over time or didn't get around to finishing the challenge. Even during those times, I learned how to articulate what I was uncertain about, and communicate clearly with my partner when he/she was unsure.

          <p class="content">
            Several times, I felt frustrated that my partner and I were not on the same page--we were both not understanding what the other was trying to suggest/point out. During these moments, I was particularly sensitive about whether I sounded condescending when walking my partner through a possible solution or pointing out what they may have missed--and vice versa--I would feel self conscious about not knowing as much or not being the one coming up with the solution. Reflecting after these moments, I know I shouldn't worry so much about not knowing all the answers. I do, however, want to be more intentional and conscious of my interactions with my partners even when things aren't going smoothly.

            <i>Feedback:</i>
            <br />
            At DBC, we are particular about how we give feedback. DBC has an interesting feedback model that not only strives to ensure that we receive helpful feedback, but also become better at giving others feedback. The process looks a little like this:
            <ol>
              <li>Write your partner Actionable, Specific, and Kind (ASK) feedback.</li>
              <li>Before you partner receives your feedback, other students will rate your feedback on whether it was indeed Actionable, Specific, and Kind.</li>
              <li>After others approve the feedback you wrote, your partner will receive your feedback!</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            I am a fan of this model because it trains me to be more alert and aware of partner interactions. I find myself "bookmarking" certain moments that I want to include in my feedback later in order to be <i>specific</i>. The more specific feedback is, the more <i>actionable</i> it becomes--they are actual pinpointed skills or concepts that can be improved upon. Phrasing all this in a <i>kind</i>, professional and positive manner makes receiving feedback an enjoyable experience.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            I appreciate all the feedback I've been receiving. Reading through the feedback makes me realize my strength in creating a positive learning environment, and my need to better establish clear roles between the driver and navigator (which I think I'm getting better at!).
