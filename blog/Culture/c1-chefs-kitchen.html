        <h4>On the DBC Learning Culture</h4>
        <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
            Listening to Shereef’s fireside chat was reassuring -- I made the right choice to enroll at DBC.  While applying to various code schools, I often got the impression that many schools were just cranking out robot developers. DBC was one of few schools that used the application/interview process as a venue for interviewees to share not only their problem solving skills, but also their background, values, and passion. After listening to Shereef, I get the impression that DBC is about more than just training developers--it is committed to teaching us how to be active, contributing, and mindful members of the developer community.

            I was particularly impressed with the emphasis on protecting the learning space and being intentional about our attitudes (restaurant vs. kitchen mindset), especially as we interact with our peers and instructors. When I was a teacher, I learned that the rigor of a curriculum is useless if the learning environment doesn’t feel safe; students shut down if they feel intimidated by other members in the classroom. They hold back from asking questions or sharing mistakes they’ve made, which are often valuable steps that are required to engage in deeper understanding of concepts.  I am so glad to see that protecting and respecting the learning environment is prioritized at DBC.

            That being said, I am still nervous about how I will participate and contribute to this ideal learning environment! The remote portion of the program is hard getting used to. At the same time, I’m nervous about the on-site portion too--I do much better talking in personal, 1-on-1 environments. I know I want to push myself in finding my voice and style as I practice articulating questions, thoughts, and feedback.
