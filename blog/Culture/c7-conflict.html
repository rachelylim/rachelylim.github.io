        <h4>On Conflicts</h4>
        <h4>September 18, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
            I am not a passive aggressive person. I often approach conflict with honest confrontation, in a way that I express how I feel, rather than accusing the person I am confronting. Most people take this well and we are able to talk things out and come to an agreement; but a few find it to be offensive, which can lead to other conflicts. This is a lesson I learned last year while living with my sister and her roommate.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            This isn't a story about dirty dishes and uncleaned floors--we were a very particular group of girls with extremely high hygenic standards. The conflict was that my sister's roommate--who I will refer to as Olga in this blog entry--does not like confrontations. In one particular moment of tension, we had returned from grocery shopping one day. Olga opened the fridge and started putting her groceries away. Since the fridge was open already, I jumped in, putting my things away too. Suddenly, without a word, Olga stormed off to the living room. It was clear she was upset about something, but I had no idea why because she did not say anything, so I continued putting my things away. A minute later, my sister walked into the kitchen, upset at me because I started putting my groceries away at the same time as Olga.

          <p class="content">
            The heart of the issue, for me, was that Olga could have just confronted me and asked that I wait until she put her groceries away first. But instead, I was upset that she used my sister, rather than confronting me directly. This was a situation between me and Olga, not my sister. But for Olga, she was offended that I had invaded her space in front of the fridge and did not feel comfortable explaining how she felt to me. At first, this just annoyed me--the first thought going through my head was "You are an educated adult. What is wrong with just telling me directly, rather than manipulating the situation by using my sister as a middle person?" What I realized a day later though, was that not everyone solves conflicts the same way as I do. Some people don't feel comfortable with being direct and I needed to be more understanding that it can be difficult for others. To resolve any lingering tension, I had a small chat with Olga that if she ever felt upset about anything I was doing, she was welcome to tell me and that I would not be offended if she just told me upfront. I wanted her to feel comfortable in her own apartment. I also asked her not to use my sister as a messenger in future conflicts.   
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            In hindsight, I think the issue could have been resolved more quickly if I didn't just shrug off the strange situation with Olga storming off while we were putting our groceries away. I should have stopped and thought about why she was reacting in that way, and asked her about it myself, rather than just continuing my business as if nothing happened. 
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Despite the situation seeming like a small and silly moment, it was important because I became more understanding of different communication styles, and how they affect conflict resolution.
