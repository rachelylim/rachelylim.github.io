        <h4>Bringing Diversity to the Tech Industry</h4>
        <h4>August 22, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
            This morning I browsed through <i><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/09/fact-sheet-president-obama-launches-new-techhire-initiative" target="_blank">this</a></i> White House Fact Sheet about the TechHire Initiative. Aside from creating opportunities to train more Americans for the high demand of tech jobs, the initiative intends to bring more diversity to the tech industry. While I applaud the efforts of the companies and communities that are partering with TechHire, I was unsure how exactly the initiative planned to promote diversity in the tech industry. 
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            The fact sheet does a great job using inclusive language, stating that the government would invest in coding schools and programs in order to "support innovative approaches to training and successfully employing low-skill individuals with barriers to training and employment including those with child care responsibilities, people with disabilities, disconnected youth, and limited English proficient workers, among others." But what does it meant to support "innovative approaches" for women and minorities? It's very ideal but awfully unclear. 
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            The curriculum and training for coding is still quite new, so I understand those innovative practices are developing. However, simply giving money to already existing schools and programs who "commit" to training underserved populations will not suddenly make diversity appear in the tech industry.Coding programs and schools should commit to actively recruiting women and underserved populations toward the industry. The reality is that most women and underserved populations are unaware that these programs and opportunities even exist. What a waste of money and investments if the targeted population is left unaware of resources intentionally set aside for them!
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Overall, I'm encouraged by the initiative. I just hope that the investments made are taken responsibly by coding schools and programs, and that the leaders in the developer community are able to find innovative approaches to first attracting women and minorities, rather than <i><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-struggles-to-hack-its-diversity-problem/2015/07/16/0b0144be-2053-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61_story.html" target="_blank">keeping them out.</a></i>
