        <h4>On Affirmations</h4>
        <h4>September 12, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
          Last week, I discussed how stereotype threats affect one's performance. There are some who believe that one way to combat stereotype threats is to use affirmations, building up and acknowledging someone's values.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
          For me, I value showing empathy and compassion, regardless of circumstance. By prioritizing empathy and compassion, I hope to be very intentional with the way i interact with others around me. I think the best way to use these values as assets to overcoming stereotype threats is by being understanding toward the people/person I am feeling threatened by. I can try to understand that the way they are projecting assumptions and biases are most likely a result of social norms, influence from media, and other external factors that often are beyond the person's control. By becoming more conscious of why others around me may have hold biases against me as a female Asian American, I can remind myself of my own abilities and confidence. I also think empathizing can make me more sensitive to others around me who may also be facing stereotype threats, and show support. 
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          I have no doubt I will continue to face stereotype threats as I continue being a part of the developer community, but I am glad that DBC is encouraging others to become more conscious about subtle interactions among peers and colleagues. While it does not necessarily provide an immediate solution, it is the right step toward creating a supportive and encouraging community.
