        <h4>Ruby vs JS: On Loops</h4>
        <h4>September 11, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
          We started learning JavaScript (JS) this week. It's really ugly and petty. Somehow, this strange and hideous language is considered to be one of the "hottest" languages in the developer community, and if you master this language, you can probably get a fancy job. In this entry, I'll compare two simple <code>while</code> loop, one in Ruby, the other in JS, both of which will accomplish the same thing. After I compare/contrast the two, you decide--Team Ruby or Team JS?
          </p>
          <p class="content">
          The <code>while</code>loops below are just going to print numbers 1 through 5. 
          </p>
          <div class="code-block">
            #Ruby Loop

            i = 1
            while i <= 5
              print i
              i += 1
            end

            # => 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

            //JavaScript Loop

            var i = 1
            while(i <= 5) {
              console.log(i);
              i++;
            };

            //=> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
          </div>

          <p class="content">
          Let's quickly run through the Ruby loop. We create a variable <code>i</code> to represent an integer, set it equal to one. We start the <code>while</code> loop. In the loop, we tell Ruby to print the integer, then increment the integer up by one, while the integer is less than or equal to 5. The result is the numbers 1 through 5 printed in the console. Pretty straightforward.
          </p>
          
          <p class="content">
          The JS loop also starts off by creating an integer. To do this, we need to use the <code>var</code> method to create a new integer, and set it equal to 1. We then create a <code>while</code> loop, and in parentheses, we define that the loop must continue while the integer is less than or equal to 5. Before moving on to what the method will do, we must open a curly bracket. Inside the curly bracket, which holds the action, we use the <code>console.log()</code> in order to print the integer on the console. After printing the integer, we also increment the integer by one using the nifty shortcut <code>++</code> after the integer. You may have noticed that each line is followed by a semicolon, which is required for "proper" syntax (although, I think the code runs without the semicolons sometimes). Finally, we end the loop with a closing curly bracket in the next line, which also ends with a semicolon.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
          Compare my paragraph walking through the Ruby loop to the paragraph describing the Javascript loop, and you can tell that Ruby is quite elegant and clean. But further experience in creating objects and methods in JS has made me realize that strengths in this barbaric language. There are some wonderful, flexible qualities about JS objects and function that make it ideal for creating games, which I hope to share with you in the near future.
