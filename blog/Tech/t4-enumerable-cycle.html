        <h4>Ruby Methods: Enumerable#cycle(n=nil)</h4>
        <h4>August 23, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
            I've been learning how to use Ruby to solve puzzles/challenges, like alphabetizing words, sorting numbers, grouping names etc. However, I'm curious how Ruby is used for the real world, to solve real situations. I found myself thinking about this while learning how to use the Enumerable#cycle(n=nil) method. If you ever wanted a short to creating loops, or easily controlling a loop to a specified number of times, this method is for you!
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Basically, the cycle method runs a block given. If you specify 'n' as an argument for cycle, it will run the cycle 'n' times; if no argument is specified, then the cycle will run infinitely (not sure when you would ever want to do that). So, for example: 
          </p>
          <code>
            pay = [4.50, 5.50, 6.0, 7.75]
            <br />
            pay.cycle(2) {|x| puts x } # => prints 4.50, 5.50, 6.0, 7.75, 4.50, 5.50, 6.0, 7.75 
            <br />
            pay.cycle {|x| puts x} # => prints the pay array FOREVER
          </code>
          <p
          <p class="content">
            What are some situations you would use this method? In the example I shared above, I could see it being useful for when you have a pay cycle, that must repeat 'x' number of times per year. Or perhaps for a research survey that must print questions for 'x' number of study participants. Or in the world of design, you might need to write a program to tell a machine to repeat a pattern a certain number of times. What are some situations you can think of? (Once I set up a comment box, I'd love to hear your thoughts...)
