        <h4>On Ruby Classes</h4>
        <h4>August 27, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
            The Ruby challenges are slowly getting more "object"-like. Before, we were completing petty tasks, like alphabetizing and sorting through numbers. Now, we are creating BINGO games, guessing games, and rolling dice! The challenges require more layers of methods to represent the complexity of the objects.

            For those of you who know me, you might know that I love starting my day watching YouTube videos of babies and animals. This puppy video is a particular favorite of mine.

            The puppy Class below includes basic "actions" that puppies tend to do--bark, poop, sleep, eat, and gain weight/grow. You can take a second to scroll through the code below.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block">
            class Puppy
              def initialize(name, weight)
                @name = name
                @weight = weight
              end

              def bark
                puts "Bark!"
              end

              def poop
                puts "big poop."
              end

              def sleep
                  puts "Zzzzzzzz......"
                  puts "(Shhh...#{@name} is sleeping...)"
                end
              end

              def eat
                puts "(#{@name} is hungry! Will you feed #{@name}? Type 'yes' or 'no'.)"
                food = gets.chomp
                if food == "yes"
                  puts "nom nom nom!"
                  puts weighs?
                else
                  puts bark
                  puts "(Poor #{@name}...)"
                end
              end

              def weighs?
                puts "(#{@name} was #{@weight} lbs."
                @weight += 5
                puts "#{@name} now weighs #{@weight} lbs!)"
              end
            end
          </div>
          <p class="content">
            After defining the class Puppy, the very first method I created inside the class is the <code>initialize</code> method. This method is often used in classes to create variables that are unique to a given situation--also known as an 'instance variable'. In this example, you see that the initialize method takes two arguments--a name and weight, each unique to the puppy you reference.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            The <code>bark</code>, <code>poop</code>, <code>sleep</code>, and <code>eat</code> methods are all going to resemble those "actions". When I command the puppy to <code>bark</code>, it'll say "Waaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!". When I tell it to poop, the console will display 'big poop' (I'm not sure how to make Ruby output a picture of poop so use your imagination here). <code>eat</code> will allow for some user interaction. 
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            The <code>eat</code> method is a little different from the simpler methods above. The user sees the puppy in the situation is hungry and is given a choice. If the user responds 'yes', then the user sees that the puppy is eating ('nom nom nom!'). Then, I called another instance method <code>puts weighs?</code> In this method, the user sees how much weight the puppy gained after the meal. And if the user chooses not to feed the puppy, then the method calls the <code>bark</code> method and scolds the user for not feeding the puppy. Calling the <code>weighs?</code> method is special here. Note how I make the puppy bark--I called the previous method <code>bark</code> in the class, by writing <code>puts bark</code>. I can do this because the methods inside a class are instance methods. If we did not have the methods <code>bark</code>, <code>poop</code>, <code>eat</code> wrapped inside the same class, we would not be able to call the methods inside another method other. You can only do this with instance methods inside a class. 
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Just to give a more detailed explanation of the method <code>weighs?</code> the first line of the method reveals the current weight of the puppy. Then it adds 5 to the current weight before revealing the new weight after the method is called.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Now, we can put all of these methods together! In the example below, I show you create a new puppy, by setting a variable name equal to a new puppy class, including arguments for the puppy's name and weight. Then, we simply use our newly created puppy class variable--bentley--and call the instance variables using the object dot method syntax. (i.e: <code>bentley.cry</code> <code>bentley.sleep</code> etc...)
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Let's say that we run the code in this order. What would we see?
          </p>

          <div class="code-block">
              bentley = puppy.new("Bentley", 2)
              bentley.cry       
              bentley.sleep    #I respond "no" here.
              bentley.eat      #I respond "yes" here.
              bentley.poop
            </div>
