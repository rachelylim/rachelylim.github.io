        <h4>On Git and GitHub</h4>
        <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>

          <p class="content">
            Open Source might seem like a beautiful thing. You make code, other people see your code, other people contribute and help out with your code, you help others with their code, everybody is friends! But this can also become a messy situation if you don't keep track of the original, master code. You might get upset if someone changed your code without your permission. Or what if someone claims they wrote your code when you were actually the first person to write it! Enter Git: a version control system that allows you to track changes, and manage the changes that are made to the master code. Version control systems, such as git, make it possible for Open Source to be a manageable space. It can also help you organize and keep track of the changes you make on your code.

              In short, Git allows you to keep track of changes through a time stamped system. It tracks what you deleted and added.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
              Git is a system that is on your local computer. GitHub, on the other hand, is a remote system via the Internet. Saving your code on GitHub is an easy way to share your code with others, to get feedback, suggestions, and solutions. Plus, in case your computer crashes and loses all your files, you'll have them stored online.
