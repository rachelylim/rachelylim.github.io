        <p class="content">
          Hello! My name is Rachel--I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I majored in Political Science and Linguistics at Haverford College, focusing my studies on language policies. After graduating, I was a Special Education teacher for two years in the School District of Philadelphia, while completing my Master's in Urban Education at the University of Pennsylvania. I then moved across the country to teach in Seattle for another year before deciding to do another cross country move to New York, in pursuit of creating well-designed education technology and systems to make teachers' lives easier and more efficient.</p>

          <p class="content">
          Aside from my passion for education and pretty/well-designed/simple things, I love traveling around our big amazing world, taking pictures (check out the instagram!), cooking, and reading.</p>

          This blog will trace my journey as a student at DBC, where I am learning to code and program. I want to use this blog to share with you not only my reflections on the technical and cultural concepts covered in DBC's curriculum, but also my personal growth as I gradually immerse myself into the developer community.
